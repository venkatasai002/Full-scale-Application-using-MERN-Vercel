# 🛡️ Auth-Based React + Node App (Full-Stack Boilerplate)

Welcome to a modern full-stack application built with **React**, **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **MikroORM**, and **PostgreSQL**.  
This project demonstrates **secure authentication**, **RBAC**, and **dynamic routing**, and is built with scalability and learning in mind.

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Authentication & Security
- JWT-based login & registration
- Role-based routing (`user`, `admin`)
- Secure route guards (frontend + backend)
- Password validation & popovers
- CSRF/XSS-safe design
- Token expiration & logout redirection

### 🧑‍💻 User Roles
- Users redirected to `/home` post login
- Admins redirected to `/dashboard`
- Protected access to `/home`, `/dashboard`, `/profile`, etc.
- Unauthorized access redirected to login

## 📅 Roadmap

### 🥇 Tier-1 Features (In Progress)

- ✅ **Profile Page with Avatar Upload**  
  Each user can upload/update their profile picture and manage their personal information.

- 🔒 **Password Reset via Token**  
  Users can request a secure password reset link sent to their email, valid for a short time.

- ✉️ **Email Verification Flow**  
  New users must verify their email before accessing protected routes, improving trust and security.

- 🧠 **Dynamic Menus (RBAC)**  
  Navigation dynamically adjusts based on user role (User, Admin), showing only allowed routes.

- 🌀 **Page Loaders & Skeleton UIs**  
  Improve UX with visual feedback while data or content is loading.

- 🔍 **Pagination & Search Filters**  
  List pages (e.g., Users, Posts, Products) support paginated display and live search functionality.

---

### 🥈 Tier-2 Features (Coming Soon)

- 🛎️ **Real-Time Notifications**  
  Use WebSockets to push alerts or updates like "new message", "profile updated", etc.

- 📊 **Activity Logs**  
  Record and display a history of user/admin actions (e.g., login time, profile update, password changes).

- 🧑‍💼 **Admin User Management**  
  Admin can view, update, or delete users, reset passwords, and assign roles.

---

### 🥉 Tier-3 Features (Advanced Goals)

- 📝 **Audit Trails**  
  Database-level change logs for sensitive operations, to trace who did what and when.

- 🎨 **Theme Switching (Dark/Light)**  
  Users can toggle between dark and light modes; preference stored per user.

- ⚡ **SSR / PWA Support**  
  Add server-side rendering (with frameworks like Next.js) and enable Progressive Web App features for offline access and installability.

### ✅ What You Should Do Next

- Replace `yourusername` and LinkedIn/GitHub links with your actual info.
- Push this to your project root as `README.md`.
- Create clear folder structure in GitHub (like `frontend/` and `backend/`).
- Add `.env.example` (if using envs in future).
